Workflows for computer-assisted language comparison: State of the Art

## 1 Introduction

- slides on calc, etc.

## 2 Workflows for Computer-Assisted Language Comparison

### From raw data to machine-readable data

- show, how data from tables is converted to long format
- show how data is segmented (morphologically, and sound-segments)
- demo on orthoprofiles
- illustrational figure on bad table format and long format
- show data in edictor, which is segmented

### From segmented words to computer-inferred cognates

- show automatic partial cognate detection
- illustrate how clusters are displayed (identifiers)
- show edictor and how cognates can be annotated

### From cognates to alignments

- show how the prosodic structure can be used to compute preliminary alignments
- show how alignments can be inspected in edictor
- show table on the structures (imnct, etc.)

### From alignments to strict, cross-semantic cognates

- illustrate the problem of alignability
- show how the algorithm works
- show how word families can be viewed in edictor

### From strict cognates to correspondence patterns

- show how correspondence patterns can be computed
- show how they can be browsed in edictor
- show how they look in table form

## Conclusion and Outlook

- mention further steps for the future
  1. semi-automated reconstruction
  2. testing consistency of cognates 
  3. testing consistency of reconstruction systems
  
- say bye bye to everybody
