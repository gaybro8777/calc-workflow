# Abstract

Structure:

- We introduce our state of the art computer-assisted language comparison workflow, including data conversion, cognate detection, template alignment and sound correspondence pattern.
- The test data is based on 10 Hmong-Mien languages which has been newly digitized and stored in Lexibank [@Chen2013]


# Introduction
The comparative method has been the core of historical linguistics since 19 century.

The traditional method has helped historical linguists understand the evolutions of languages and reconstruct the history of some language families. However, the increasing amounts of digital data in the field of hisotircal linguistics has been
