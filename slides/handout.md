# Abstract

Structure: 

- We introduce our state of the art computer-assisted language comparison workflow, including data conversion, cognate detection, template alignment and sound correspondence pattern. 
- The test data is based on 10 Hmong-Mien languages which has been newly digitized and stored in Lexibank [@Chen2013]


# Introduction
The comparative method has been the core of historical linguistics since 19 century. The scheme involves intensive human linguists manually annotate the cognates by comparing phenomes in order to reconstruct the history of Indo-European language family; later, the method was then applied onto several linguistc families with further refinements. The traditional method, although slow regarding research progress, has helped historical linguists understand the evolutions of languages and recontruct the history of language families. However, the increasing amounts of digital data in hisotircal linguistics has been exceed the capacity of the traditional approach.
